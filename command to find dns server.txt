command to find dns server.txt

nslookup – Simple Example

nslookup followed by the domain name will display the “A Record” ( IP Address ) of the domain.

$ nslookup redhat.com

Server:		192.168.19.2
Address:	192.168.19.2#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	redhat.com
Address: 209.132.183.181
In the above output, server refers to the IP address of the DNS server. Then the below section provides the “A Record” ( IP Address ) of the domain “redhat.com”.

The default output of nslookup command is less cluttered than the default output of dig command. Some of you might be comfortable using dig command for DNS lookups.
