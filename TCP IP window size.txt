TCP/IP window size.txt

The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) receive window size is the maximum amount of received data, in bytes, that can be buffered at one time on the receiving side of a connection. The sending host can send only that amount of data before waiting for an acknowledgment and window update from the receiving host."
