WHAT ARE INODES?

An index node (or inode) contains metadata information (file size, file type, etc.) for a file system object (like a file or a directory). There is one inode per file system object.

An inode doesn't store the file contents or the name: it simply points to a specific file or directory.



What is in an inode?

Before I said the data blocks contain the contents of the file. The inode contains the following pieces of information

Mode/permission (protection)
Owner ID
Group ID
Size of file
Number of hard links to the file
Time last accessed
Time last modified
Time inode last modified
