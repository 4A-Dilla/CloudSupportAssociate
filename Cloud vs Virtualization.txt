Cloud vs Virtualization.txt

virtualization is software that separates physical infrastructures to create various dedicated resources. It is the fundamental technology that powers cloud computing

Virtualization software makes it possible to run multiple operating systems and multiple applications on the same server at the same time 

It enables businesses to reduce IT costs while increasing the efficiency, utilization and flexibility of their existing computer hardware

The technology behind virtualization is known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM) or virtual manager, which separates compute environments from the actual physical infrastructure 

How is virtualization different from cloud computing? 

virtualization is software that manipulates hardware, while cloud computing refers to a service that results from that manipulation

Virtualization is a foundational element of cloud computing and helps deliver on the value of cloud computing,Cloud computing is the delivery of shared computing resources, software or data — as a service and on-demand through the Internet 

The cloud can, and most often does, include virtualization products to deliver the compute service，The difference is that a true cloud provides self-service capability, elasticity, automated management, scalability and pay-as you go service that is not inherent in virtualization



cloud computing as having the following:

On-Demand Self-Service – can I unilaterally provision computing capabilities?
Broad Network Access – can I access through multiple clients and devices over network?
Resource Pooling – can I decouple resources from physical hardware?----》 virtualization
Rapid Elasticity – can I add and reduce capacity through software?
Measured Service – who is using what and how much?
