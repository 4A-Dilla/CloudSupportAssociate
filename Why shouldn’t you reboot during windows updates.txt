Why shouldnâ€™t you reboot during windows updates.txt

It all depends on what the update is doing, and at what particular time you shut it down during that process... Possible outcomes include:

Nothing at all happening, and Windows resuming the installation process next time you shutdown.
A non-vital program file becomes corrupted and causes some feature of the OS to become unusable and crash.
Which could possibly be fixed by using Windows Restore to "restore Windows to an earlier state."
A non-bootable system that has to fixed using one of two methods:
Using a Windows Recovery CD to check and repair errors.
A complete re-install of Windows.
