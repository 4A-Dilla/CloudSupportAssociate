Compromised Systems
If your system has been compromised, somebody is probably using your machine--possibly to scan and find other machines to compromise. There is no automated method for cleaning up a compromised machine. Our recommendation:

Back up important personal files
Reformat the hard drive
Reinstall the operating system and software

signs indicating ur system is compromised:
Fake antivirus messages
Unwanted browser toolbars
Redirected Internet searches
Frequent random popups
Your friends receive fake emails from your email account
Your online passwords suddenly change
Unexpected software installs
Your mouse moves between programs and makes correct selections
Your antimalware software, Task Manager, or Registry Editor is disabled and can't be restarted
Your bank account is missing money
You get calls from stores about nonpayment of shipped goods
