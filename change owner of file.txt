change owner of file.txt

Use chown to change ownership and chmod to change rights.

sudo chown -R username:group directory
will change ownership (both user and group) of all files and directories inside of directory and directory itself.

sudo chown username:group directory
will only change the permission of the folder directory but will leave the files and folders inside the directory alone.
