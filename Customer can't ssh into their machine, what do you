Customer can't ssh into their machine, what do you do.txt

reinstall ssh?
close iptables?
reset passwd?

You need to run ssh (the client, and possibly the server) with more verbosity to understand why authentication is failing. For the client, run

ssh -v -v -v username@host 
On the server end, look in the logs. /var/log/auth.log will give you a pretty good idea about what happens when you try to login, look for messages that contain "sshd". There are a variety of reasons why authentication could be failing, ranging from simple (you aren't using the right username) to more complicated (sshd is configured to use the wrong authentication system).
