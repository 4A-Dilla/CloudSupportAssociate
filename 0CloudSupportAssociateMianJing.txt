DB:

用户连不上网站，看是不是网站hosting的server挂了；

如果hosting的server没事儿，看看是不是连的DB挂了；

如果都没事儿，是不是Load Balancer挂了。

如果都没事儿，查查DB是不是哪个query一直完成不了，block了所有人。


一旦Alarm响了，用户报告网速慢了、response time太长了，你能迅速反应，然后找到root cause（程序问题还是server问题？server不堪负荷还是怎样）就行。


最最重要的一点，把口语练好，想说的练好。除了技术和知识内容，一定要表现出：

（1） 爱交流，善于交流，他们不求你解决问题，好多时候就是把国内的用户的信息和情况反馈一下就行；
（2） 有逻辑，有步骤，迅速能汇报清楚发生了什么；
（3） 主动性强，不怕累，不怕烦。


你有时间赶紧恶补server啊、维护啊这些内容。就了解最基本的架构就行（比如看维基百科的图就行）。细节一概不管。

分布式：

1个活放在10个机器做 然后汇总
1个cache太大  分到10个机器 记住存在哪里  在汇总


DB
http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join.asp
INNER JOIN = join 就是找两个table共同的条目: Returns all rows when there is at least one match in BOTH tables
LEFT JOIN 左边table全要 右边找共同的 没有的就是null: Return all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table
RIGHT JOIN: Return all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table
FULL JOIN: Return all rows when there is a match in ONE of the tables

怎么知道一个DB down?

show status;

sudo service mysql status

or

ps aux | grep mysql

What you're facing is probably authentication failure or database misspell.

Did you try logging in with same creds via Terminal?

mysql -u <username> -p <database-name>

What shows that a database server is running?
Database servers run as services or daemons, most times in the background without the necessity to see that they are running in order to interact with them. When things go sideways however, being able to verify that the service is in fact up and running can be an excellent place to start troubleshooting. Checking under the services area of your particular operating system, whether that be by GUI or by CLI, can show you that the service is started or not, thus allowing you either to start or restart it as need be.

怎么衡量一个DB的当前performance?

8.13.3 Using Your Own Benchmarks
8.13.4 Measuring Performance with performance_schema : https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/performance-schema-status-monitoring.html





You can use Maatkit's query profiler to measure impact of data amount on MySQL performances.

And generatedata.com to generate the data you need to test your app.

You can also test your application responsiveness using HTTP testing tools like :

Apache's bundled 'ab' tool (Apache Bench)
JMeter
Selenium


https://www.pythian.com/blog/do-you-know-if-your-database-slow/

database performance is either the response time of the operations the end-user do and/or  the amount of work the database instance does in a certain time period – throughput.



LInux：

1. 为什么 LVM 是必需的？

LVM 的意思是逻辑卷管理器，它可以帮助我们根据文件系统的大小重新在线调整 Linux 中的 LVM 分区的大小。我们可以分别使用 lvextend 和 lvreduce 命令来增加或减小 LVM 分区的大小。

2. 如何内存和 CPU 的统计数据？

我们可以分别使用 ‘free’ 和 ‘vmstat’ 命令来查看物理内存和虚拟内存的统计数据。使用 ‘sar’ 命令，我们可以看到 CPU 使用率以及其他资料。

3. Sar 提供了什么？Sar日志的存储位置在哪里？

Sar 收集，报告，保存系统的活动信息。Sar 命令的默认版本（CPU 使用率报告）可能是用户执行系统活动调查时第一个用到的，因为它监控着大部分系统资源。当 CPU 利用率接近100%时，采样的工作负载时 CPU 密集型的。

Sar 命令的默认日志文件位于 /var/log/sa/sadd 文件，其中 dd 代表着当前日期。

4. 如何增加 LVM 分区的大小？

下面是逻辑步骤：

-使用 lvextend 命令（lvextend -L +100M/dev/<Name of the LVM Partition>, 在这里，我们给指定分区增加了100MB 的大小）

–resize2fs /dev/<Name of the LVM Partition>

-使用’df -h’命令检查分区的大小

5. 如何缩小 LVM 分区的大小？

下面是缩小 LVM 分区大小的逻辑步骤：

-使用 umount 命令卸载文件系统

-使用 resize2fs 命令，例如：resiz2fs /dev/mapper/myvg-mylv 10G

-然后使用 lvreduce 命令，例如：lvreduce -L 10G /dev/mapper/myvg-mylv

以上的命令会缩小文件系统10GB的大小。

6. 如何从原始磁盘创建分区？

使用 fdisk，我们可以从原始磁盘创建分区。下面是具体步骤：

–fdisk  /dev/hd* (IDE) 或者 /dev/sd* (SCSI)

-输入n来创建一个新分区

-创建分区之后，输入w命令来保存磁盘分区信息。

7. 内核模块的位置在哪里？

在‘/lib/modules/kernel-version/’目录下存储着 Linux  操作系统中所有内核模块以及编译的驱动程序。我们也可以使用 ‘lsmod’ 命令查看所有安装的内核模块。

8. 什么是umask?

umask 意思是“用户文件创建掩码”，这决定了一个掩码控制哪些文件的权限在文件和目录被创建的时候。

9. 如何永久为用户设置 umask?

为了永久的给用户设置 umask 值，这个值必需存储在由用户默认的 shell 所确定的合适的配置文件中。

10. 如何改变Linux中默认的运行级别？

为了改变运行级别，我们必须编辑“/etc/inittab”文件，并且改变默认的运行等级（id:5:initdefault:），使用‘init’命令，我们改变当前的运行级别。例如：‘init 3’，这个命令将会把系统的运行级别改为第三级。

11. 如何使用 nfs 共享目录？

使用 nfs 分享目录，我们首先要编辑‘/etc/exportfs’文件，加上一个入口，例如：‘/<directory-name>  <ip or Network>(Options)’，然后重新启动 nfs 服务。

12. 如何检查并挂载 nfs 共享？

使用 ‘showmount’ 命令，我们可以看到有哪些目录通过 nfs 被共享了，例如：‘showmount -e <ip address of nfs server>’。使用 mount 命令，我们能够在 Linux 上挂载 nfs 共享。

13. SMTP, DNS, FTP, DHCP, SSH 和 squid 使用的默认端口号是哪些？

服务              端口号

SMTP                25

 DNS                  53

 FTP                    20（数据传输），21（建立连接）

DHCP                67/UDP（dhcp 服务端），68/UDP（dhcp 客户端）

SSH                    22

 Squid                  3128

14. 什么是网络绑定？

网络绑定是将多个 LAN 卡聚合在一起形成一个单一的绑定接口，来提供容错性和高性能。网络绑定也被叫做NIC Teaming。

15. Linux中不同的网络绑定模式有哪些？

下面是网络绑定中被使用的模式：

balance-rr or 0 –  循环模式来提高容错性和负载平衡。

active-backup or 1 – 设置主动备份模式来提高容错性。

balance-xor or 2 – 设置XOR（异或）模式来提高容错性和负载平衡。

broadcast or 3 – 设置广播模式来提高容错能力，所有信息都会复制从所有的接口发出去。

802.3ad or 4 – 设置IEEE 802.3ad动态链接聚合模式。创建一个共享相同速度和双工设置的聚焦组。

balance-tlb or 5 – 设置传输负载平衡（TLB）模式提高容错性和负载平衡

balance-alb or 6 – 设置有源负载平衡（ALB）模式提高容错性和负载平衡

16.  如何检查和验证bond界面的状态？

使用‘cat /proc/net/bonding/bond0’命令，我们能够检查哪种模式被激活，什么 LAN 卡被使用。在这个例子中，我们只有一个 bond 接口，但是我们可以有多个 bond 接口，例如 bond1，bond2 等等。

17. 如何检查默认路由以及路由表？

使用 ‘netstat -nr’ 和 ‘route -n’ 命令我们可以查看默认路由以及路由表。

18. 如何检查哪些端口正在监听我的 Linux 服务器？

使用 ‘netstat -l’ 和 ‘lsof -i’ 命令

19. 列出在一个特定的运行级别上，Linux 服务器所启动的服务。

使用‘chkconfig –list | grep 5:on’命令，我们可以列出在运行级别5上启动的服务。查看其他运行级别是，只要将5换成对应的级别。

20. 如何在一个特定的运行级别上启动服务？

我们可以使用类似 ‘chkconfig <Service-Name> on –level 3’ 的命令。

21. 如何升级 Linux 的内核？

我们不应该升级 Linux 内核，而是始终使用 rpm 命令来安装新的内核，因为升级内核会让你的 Linux 机器处于一个无法启动的状态。

22. 如何扫描在 Linux 中新分配的 luns，而不需要重新启动？

有两种方法可以查看新分配的 luns：

方法1： 如果安装了 sg3 rpm，那么运行命令‘rescan-scsi-bus.sh’

方法2：运行命令 echo ” – – – ” > /sys/class/scsi_host/hostX/scan

23. 如何找到 HBA 卡在 Linux 服务器上的 WWN 号码？

使用命令 ‘systool -c fc_host -v | grep port_name’

24. 如何添加和修改内核参数？

要设置  Linux 中的内核参数，首先编辑 ‘/etc/sysctl.conf’ 文件，修改之后保存文件，运行命令 ‘sysctl -p’，这个命令可以永久保持修改而无需重新启动机器。

25. 什么是Puppet 服务器？

Puppet 是一个开源和企业软件，用来配置管理 UNIX 中的 toll 如操作系统。Puppet是一个自动化软件，使用代码推送配置到他的客户端（puppet 代理）。Puppet 代码可以完了各种任务，从安装新软件到检查文件权限，或者更新用户账户以及很多其他任务。

26. Puppet 中的 manifests 是什么？

Puppet 中的 mainfests 是指定客户端配置的文件。

27. 在 Puppet 服务器中哪一个命令用于给请求的证书签名？

在2.x中使用 ‘puppetca  –sign hostname-of-agent’

在3.x中使用 ‘puppet ca  sign hostname-of-agent’

28. Puppet Master 在哪里存储证书？

/var/lib/puppet/ssl/ca/signed

29. 如何在目录中找到所有的常规文件？

使用命令 ‘find /<directory -type f’。

30. 在 Linux 中什么是平均负载？

平均负载被定义为在1分钟，5分钟和15分钟内等待在运行队列中的进程数目和当前正在执行的进程数目之和的平均值。使用 ‘top’ 和 ‘uptime’ 命令我们可以查询一个 Linux 服务器的平均负载。







Glassdoor:

1. he interviewer was helpful and asked questions on networking or troubleshooting. A few questions included DNS, DHCP, Hadoop and cloud computing basics.

Explain how DNS works :
The computer checks it's DNS records and does not have it correct one. It then requests the record from the router. The router doesn't know so it goes to the ISP for the DNS record. The ISP doesn't know so it asks the ROOT SERVER for the correct NAME SERVER. Your ISP asks the NAME SERVER for the DNS record. When your ISP has the record it passes it to your router which in turn passes it to you computer. Now you computer has the IP address of the site it wants to visit.

2. If a server failed to do a nightly backup, what could be a reason for that?  

3.The focus was on the projects that I had on resume and lot of basics of networking questions.

The most difficult question I felt was " What if you have two customers with same problem at the same time, whom you will give the priority and why" 

The best answer to this is...I will follow the SLAs (Service Level Agreements) and find out which client will have to be paid more compensation in case the issue isnt solved in time.
That client will be given clear priority.

Networking, second was Operating Systems (Windows or Linux, I picked Windows) and the final was a "general" interview focusing on competency, previous experience, Amazon leadership principles and a troubleshooting scenario.

Questions ranged from knowledge/understanding to support questions whereby you are given a scenario and are tasked with troubleshooting. They didn't expect you to know everything, they try to find out how much you know, gauge your understanding and communication skills.


When you type a URL into your web browser, what happens when you press enter?  

A client in Germany is trying to access a server in London, but his connection is running slow. You are in Dublin. How do you diagnose his issue?  

What happens when you press the power button on your PC?  


"I have forgotten my password, how will you help me?"  

How do you find out what your IP Address is?  



27. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Three 30 mins interviews, the first ask about networking, the second is about windows troubleshooting, the third is about leadership which you should answer the questions with your own experience.
the networking part question:
what is the difference about UDP and TCP, what kind of application base on UDP
what is FTP? what kind of application it used for?
what the different between HTTP and HTTPS? and why HTTPs more secure?
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
something related with IP address
I find the questions always go to the details, and ask why it is and try to test your understanding and your passion in technology.
I did not do well in the trouble shooting, because i did not prepare it at all

for the leadership part, the questions are like: give me an example about how did you deal with multiple tasks, how did you handle deadline, how did you deal with angry clients....

what is difference between TCP and UDP. give a application example for each.  


32.

What happens when you type an address into a browser and press enter  

The Browser (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer) checks the cache to see if it already exists, if not it asks the OS for the servers IP address, Then the OS does a DNS lookup after which it replies the IP address to the browser, The browser then opens a TCP connection and sends the HTTP request, the browser receives the HTTP response and may close the TCP connection depending if it decides to use it for another request. If its cacheable, response is stored and the browser decodes the response and renders HTTP response

Interview Questions
If you were interviewing you, what are the three questions you would be asking?  

41.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
because of non disclosure agreement, I won't be able to say the question but just make sure you focus on neworking (as they will go deep om this), DNS, TCP/IP, FiREWALL, LOAD BALANCER etc. And most importantly please, please and please read and understand amazon leadership principle. If you really wanna work at amazon, you will need not only to understand the principles but been able to relate to it and come up with a scenario when you applied the principle.

- Explain TCP congestion control and how it works (average round trip timer retries)
- Explain everything in detail that happens when you type www.amazon.com into your browser (you will have to explain everything that happens in all the OSI layers, DHCP, DNS, routing protocols, HTTP ports and commands, TCP, load balancing, reverse proxies, CSS, databases, etc)
- An FTP download starts slow and then speeds up towards the end. Why is that?
- If you were to set up amazon.com from scratch, what would you do? (essentially describe everything involved in filling a datacentre with networking, hardware, software, storage, and getting it seen on the internet)
- What does a router do if the MTU is too small for the packet (packet fragmentation, but you can talk about MSS and PMTUD)
- What kind of DNS record that tells the name server to find it's own domain by looking at it's own records to avoid a recursive loop? (A DNS glue record)

- How can a filesystem say it has free space but you are unable to write anything into it (out of inodes)
- What happens when a router receives a packet? (describe routing, forwarding, and encapsulation processes)
- What are the differences between OSPF and BGP? (OSPF is link-state used internally in sites, BGP is path vector - and connects sites via AS numbers to the public internet)

What is active directory ?  

FSMO roles ? What are they used for ? If you know some of their names you can list some of them ?  

Where exactly are these roles located in the server ? He probably meant in what directory and file.  

What is the tool used for editing these roles ? For example if you want to make some changes to this roles ?
I tried to explain where the tool if found. But he insisted and wanted a name for the tool, I did not remember it really so I passed this one also.


60. 
What is the difference between UDP and TCP/IP?  
Both work on transport layer.
TCP is connection-oriented protocol, the package will be sent and a answer is expected, on UDP there is no answer, the protocol doesn't know if the package arrived.
TCP send packages on the sent order, UDP doesn't have any order.
TCP examples: www, mail, ftp and ssh.

Windows interview was nasty for me, was a bit strange and caught me unprepared. Some very hard questions (FSMO scenarios, client troubleshooting) and some of the general IT questions, apparently easy (what's the difference between WinSrv2003 and WinSrv2008, describe the process of windows boot). Even if you have a huge experience, you might get in trouble.
   Network interview was a lot more easier than I expected. Some decent, basic questions, scaling with the rate of correct answers given (I said stop when I reached OSPF configuration :)).
